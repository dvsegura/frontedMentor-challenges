                                    joined the
                                    bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                                    transition and have
                                    heard some people who had an amazing
                                    experience here. I
                                    signed up for the free intro course and
                                    found it
                                    incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                                    thereafter. The next 12
                                    weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                                    time of my life.
                                    Since completing the course, I’ve
                                    successfully switched

                            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
                            a
                            former
                            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum

                            staff
                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                            agile team
                            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that

                            tutorial
                            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                            developent
                            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                            multiple
                            offers.
